                                        🧭 Employee Tracker — Role-Based Workforce Management System

**Employee Tracker** is a full-stack web application built by a team of four graduate students from Indiana University to streamline HR operations, reduce manual overhead, and create transparency in organizational workflows. Designed for startups and growing businesses, it provides secure, role-specific dashboards that automate everything from attendance tracking and task assignments to training, feedback, and audit logging.

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

Modern HR shouldn't revolve around fragmented spreadsheets and approval bottlenecks. Our goal was to design a system that simplifies workforce management by offering intuitive interfaces, secure data flows, and real-time visibility across organizational roles. With the growing need for integrated platforms in small businesses, *Employee Tracker* offers a scalable solution built with usability and structure in mind.
